# Car-Sales-Analysis-and-Prediction-Project
A data science project focused on analyzing historical car sales data and predicting future trends using Python and machine learning. This project aims to uncover valuable insights from car sales data spanning over two decades, leveraging data science techniques for exploratory analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling.

Project Overview :-

This project explores a comprehensive dataset on car sales, applying data processing, statistical analysis, and machine learning models to derive actionable insights. By analyzing sales patterns, brand performance, and historical trends, this project aims to assist decision-makers in the automotive industry with data-driven insights.

Key Objectives :-

Data Analysis: Cleaning and structuring raw car sales data for thorough analysis.

Trend Analysis: Uncovering sales trends and variations by year and manufacturer.

Predictive Modeling: Building machine learning models to forecast future car sales based on historical data.

Project Structure :-

Data Preparation: Data cleaning steps include handling duplicates, null values, and basic statistical summarization.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and descriptive statistics are used to analyze car sales trends, distribution of sales across companies, and year-over-year changes.

Machine Learning Models:

Linear Regression: Used for sales prediction based on independent variables in the dataset.

Decision Tree: Applied for classification tasks within the dataset.

Random Forest Regressor: Implemented for advanced predictive modeling, enhancing prediction accuracy.

Model Evaluation: Each model is evaluated for accuracy, and their results are compared to determine the best approach for future sales prediction.

Technologies and Libraries Used :-

Python: Core programming language for the project.

Pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation and numerical analysis.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization to display trends and insights.

Scikit-learn: Machine learning models and evaluation tools.

Results and Insights :-

The analysis and models provide:

Yearly trends in car sales with insights into high-performing brands.

Predictive insights to forecast sales, assisting in planning and strategy formulation.

These insights have potential applications for businesses to predict market changes and make informed strategic decisions in the automotive sector.
